1). SINGLE RESPONSABILITIES PRINCIPLE:
a class should have only reason to change, separations of concerns,  different handling, 
independient task/problems.

2). OPEN-CLOSED PRINCIPLE:
classes should be open for extension but closed to modifications.

3). LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE:
it should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype.

4). INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE:
Don't put to much into an interface, split into separate interfaces (you ain't going to need it).

5). DEPENDENCY INVERSION PRINCIPLE:
High-Level modules should not depend upon Low-Level ones; use abstractions insted.
